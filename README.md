* Liskov Substitution Principle (Liskov)
* Interface Segregation Principle (InterfaceSegreation)
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DependencyInversionPrinciple)
* Builder Pattern (BuilderPattern)
  * Fluent builder using SELF (BuilderBattern.FluentBuilderInheritance) - Need to figure out how to rename project in Rider. Its a "pattern" not a "battern"
